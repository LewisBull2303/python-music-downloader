# python-music-downloader
This is the second of 2 projects that I made to better understand how to make a project that can use a HTML link and convert the items inside that link to mp4 or mp3 format. I could apply what i learnt in this project toward a project where I grab HTML links with text files and convert them into a downloadable format.
